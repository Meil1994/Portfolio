        <p class='pt-7'>
            Hello! I am <span class='dark:text-white underline underline-offset-4'>Meilchu T. Cabaluna</span> from Davao City. 
            I enjoy doing things that are challenging yet fun like developing a website. 
            Contrary to what you may think of me, in personality and appearance. 
            I also enjoy reading manga and watching anime as a hobby.
        </p>

            I started to have an interest in learning to code about a year ago. 
            One day, I saw this learning website that my daughter was using. 
            It is simple yet a very fun one. Then a question suddenly popped into my mind. 
            How did they do it? Will I be able to do it? How will I do it? 
            That's when I started studying, and eventually enrolled and finished boot camp at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/KodegoPH' target='blank' class='text-indigo-900 dark:text-indigo-300'>KodeGo</a>.
